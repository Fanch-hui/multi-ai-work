## App 执行约定

先读取本技能正文及任务所需的本地参考资源。使用中文；工作目录由任务提供，仅读取用户提供、当前任务授权的资料。正文中的 `$ARGUMENTS` 及斜杠命令表示用户任务输入，不调用 Claude 专用命令。`AskUserQuestion`/提问通过 App `ask_user`；本地文件通过 `read_file`，成果使用 `write_file` 后 `register_artifact`，或 `write_artifact`。相对资源路径以本 SKILL.md 所在目录为起点。若技能读取结果含目录，按该目录构建资源绝对路径。

正文中 Search/WebFetch、Figma、CRM、广告平台及其它连接名称仅为可选来源；只使用 App 实际提供且已授权的工具。没有连接时从上传材料完成流程，把缺少的外部验证列出，不安装运行时插件或扫描用户全局配置。默认输出 Markdown/CSV 草稿；Office、图表、HTML、PNG 或图像生成只在对应工具和运行库可用时执行。不得擅自发送邮件、发表内容、签约、创建发票、修改线上商品或花费广告预算。

## Analyze Feature Requests

Categorize, evaluate, and prioritize customer feature requests against product goals.

### Context

You are analyzing feature requests for **$ARGUMENTS**.

If the user provides files (spreadsheets, CSVs, or documents with feature requests), read and analyze them directly. If data is in a structured format, consider creating a summary table.

### Domain Context

Never allow customers to design solutions. Prioritize **opportunities (problems)**, not features. Use **Opportunity Score** (Dan Olsen) to evaluate customer-reported problems: Opportunity Score = Importance × (1 − Satisfaction), normalized to 0–1. See the `prioritization-frameworks` skill for full details and templates.

### Instructions

The user will describe their product goal and provide feature requests. Work through these steps:

1. **Understand the goal**: Confirm the product objective and desired outcomes that will guide prioritization.

2. **Categorize requests into themes**: Group related requests together and name each theme.

3. **Assess strategic alignment**: For each theme, evaluate how well it aligns with the stated goals.

4. **Prioritize the top 3 features** based on:
   - **Impact**: Customer value and number of users affected
   - **Effort**: Development and design resources required
   - **Risk**: Technical and market uncertainty
   - **Strategic alignment**: Fit with product vision and goals

5. **For each top feature**, provide:
   - Rationale (customer needs, strategic alignment)
   - Alternative solutions worth considering
   - High-risk assumptions
   - How to test those assumptions with minimal effort

Think step by step. Save as markdown or create a structured output document.
