## App 执行约定

先读取本技能正文及任务所需的本地参考资源。使用中文；工作目录由任务提供，仅读取用户提供、当前任务授权的资料。正文中的 `$ARGUMENTS` 及斜杠命令表示用户任务输入，不调用 Claude 专用命令。`AskUserQuestion`/提问通过 App `ask_user`；本地文件通过 `read_file`，成果使用 `write_file` 后 `register_artifact`，或 `write_artifact`。相对资源路径以本 SKILL.md 所在目录为起点。若技能读取结果含目录，按该目录构建资源绝对路径。

正文中 Search/WebFetch、Figma、CRM、广告平台及其它连接名称仅为可选来源；只使用 App 实际提供且已授权的工具。没有连接时从上传材料完成流程，把缺少的外部验证列出，不安装运行时插件或扫描用户全局配置。默认输出 Markdown/CSV 草稿；Office、图表、HTML、PNG 或图像生成只在对应工具和运行库可用时执行。不得擅自发送邮件、发表内容、签约、创建发票、修改线上商品或花费广告预算。

# Test Scenarios

Create comprehensive test scenarios from user stories with test objectives, starting conditions, user roles, step-by-step test actions, and expected outcomes.

**Use when:** Writing QA test cases, creating test plans, defining acceptance test scenarios, or validating user story implementations.

**Arguments:**
- `$PRODUCT`: The product or system name
- `$USER_STORY`: The user story to test (title and acceptance criteria)
- `$CONTEXT`: Additional testing context or constraints

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Review the user story** and acceptance criteria
2. **Define test objectives** - What specific behavior to validate
3. **Establish starting conditions** - System state, data setup, configurations
4. **Identify user roles** - Who performs the test actions
5. **Create test steps** - Break down interactions step-by-step
6. **Define expected outcomes** - Observable results after each step
7. **Consider edge cases** - Invalid inputs, boundary conditions
8. **Output detailed test scenarios** - Ready for QA execution

## Scenario Template

**Test Scenario:** [Clear scenario name]

**Test Objective:** [What this test validates]

**Starting Conditions:**
- [System state required]
- [Data or configuration needed]
- [User setup or permissions]

**User Role:** [Who performs the test]

**Test Steps:**
1. [First action and its expected result]
2. [Second action and observable outcome]
3. [Third action and system behavior]
4. [Completion action and final state]

**Expected Outcomes:**
- [Observable result 1]
- [Observable result 2]
- [Observable result 3]

## Example Test Scenario

**Test Scenario:** View Recently Viewed Products on Product Page

**Test Objective:** Verify that the 'Recently viewed' section displays correctly and excludes the current product.

**Starting Conditions:**
- User is logged in or has browser history enabled
- User has viewed at least 2 products in the current session
- User is now on a product page different from previously viewed items

**User Role:** Online Shopper

**Test Steps:**
1. Navigate to any product page → Section should appear at bottom with previously viewed items
2. Scroll to bottom of page → "Recently viewed" section is visible with product cards
3. Verify product thumbnails → Images, titles, and prices are displayed correctly
4. Check current product → Current product is NOT in the recently viewed list
5. Click on a product card → User navigates to the corresponding product page

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Recently viewed section appears only after viewing at least 1 prior product
- Section displays 4-8 product cards with complete information
- Current product is excluded from the list
- Each card shows "Viewed X minutes/hours ago" timestamp
- Clicking cards navigates to correct product pages
- Performance: Section loads within 2 seconds

## Output Deliverables

- Comprehensive test scenarios for each acceptance criterion
- Clear test objectives aligned with user story intent
- Detailed step-by-step test actions
- Observable expected outcomes after each step
- Edge case and error scenario coverage
- Ready for QA team execution and documentation
